# Data Structures and Algorithms Project

This project is a collection of various algorithms and data structures implemented in Java and Python.

## Directory Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `src/main/java/com/akshayram/algorithms`: Contains various algorithm implementations, including searching, sorting, and Dijkstra's algorithm.
- `src/main/java/com/akshayram/basicprograms`: Contains basic Java programs, such as hash generation and pattern printing.
- `src/test/java/com/akshayram/leetcode`: Includes test cases for your algorithms.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies which files and directories to ignore when pushing to a version control repository.
- `README.md`: The file you are currently reading, providing an overview of the project.
- `pom.xml`: The Maven project configuration file.

Feel free to explore and contribute to this project. You can add more data structures, algorithms, and test cases as needed.

## Project Contents

1. **Algorithms**:
    - The `algorithms` package contains various algorithm implementations.
    - It covers topics like searching, sorting, and graph algorithms.
    - Explore these algorithms to understand their working and applications.

2. **Basic Programs**:
    - The `basicprograms` package contains simple Java programs.
    - These programs are designed to help you practice basic coding concepts.
    - Use these as a warm-up or for quick coding exercises.

3. **Testing**:
    - The `test` directory includes test cases for your algorithms and programs.
    - Write and run tests to ensure your code behaves as expected.
